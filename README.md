# The-Gene-Cosmos
## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for The Gene Cosmos Project, dedicated to the preservation and analysis of the human Y chromosome's original data. This project aims to process this data through segmentation and apply advanced techniques for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Repository Contents
 Y_chr.fasta: The original FASTA file containing the Y chromosome DNA sequence.

 dnaProcess.py: This script processes the Y chromosome DNA by segmenting the data and extracting it into numpy files. Each data point in the resulting matrix represents the frequency of the processed segments.

 reduction.py: This script performs dimensionality reduction on the numpy files generated by dnaProcess.py and visualizes the final data, helping in the interpretation of genetic variations and patterns.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher <br>
NumPy <br>
Matplotlib (for visualization)<br>
Scikit-learn (for dimensionality reduction)
