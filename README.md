# The-Gene-Cosmos
Algorithm for The Gene Cosmos project. 
Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for The Gene Cosmos Project, dedicated to the preservation and analysis of the human Y chromosome's original data. This project aims to process this data through segmentation and apply advanced techniques for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Repository Contents
Y_chr.fasta: The original FASTA file containing the Y chromosome DNA sequence.

dnaProcess.py: This script processes the Y chromosome DNA by segmenting the data and extracting it into numpy files. Each data point in the resulting matrix represents the frequency of the processed segments.

reduction.py: This script performs dimensionality reduction on the numpy files generated by dnaProcess.py and visualizes the final data, helping in the interpretation of genetic variations and patterns.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Scikit-learn (for dimensionality reduction)
Installation
